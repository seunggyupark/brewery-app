# PLEASE READ: This is the first application I made when I had little knowledge of programming. This is not a reflection of my ability but a reference to what my first project was.

**Summary:** This project was to digitize and automate systems at the brewery I worked at. It uses Google Apps Script to run the logic, AppSheet to collect data (a code-free tool for making apps), and AppSheet then stores the data in Google Sheets. Features report automation, task management automation, processing fermentation, cellar, brewing, packaging, lab, and sensory data.
